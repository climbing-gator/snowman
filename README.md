# snowman
A word guessing game

## Game description
Snowman is a game based on the hangman word game. A user can submit a text file with words they'd like the player to guess. Only one word is guessed at a time. The player is shown empty spaces for each letter in the word to be guessed. The player guesses letters that could be in the word. Any time a letter is guessed correctly, the letter is displayed in the appropriate location in the spaces shown. If the player guesses a wrong letter, the snowman gets a new body part (body, head, arms, eyes, mouth, nose). The player is allowed 9 incorrect guesses before the game is over. At any point, the player can guess the word. A wrong guess also results in the snowman getting a new body part. The player must guess the right word to win the game.
